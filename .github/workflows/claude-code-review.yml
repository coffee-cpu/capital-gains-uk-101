            Review this PR with the following focus areas specific to this Capital Gains Tax Visualiser project:

            ## HMRC Compliance (Critical for tax-related changes)

            For changes in `src/lib/cgt/`, `src/lib/enrichment.ts`, `src/utils/taxYear.ts`, or tax calculation components:
            - Verify calculation logic aligns with HMRC guidance
            - Cross-reference with: TCGA92/S105(1) (same-day), TCGA92/S106A(5) (30-day), TCGA92/S104 (Section 104), TCGA92/S127 (share reorganisations)
            - Check UK tax year boundaries (April 6 - April 5) are handled correctly
            - Ensure user-facing explanations include HMRC references (CG51560, CG51620, CG51127)

            ## Code Quality

            - TypeScript strict mode compliance
            - No unused variables or imports
            - Clean separation between `GenericTransaction` (raw data) and `EnrichedTransaction` (computed fields)
            - Test coverage for new logic

            ## Privacy & Security

            - No external data transmission (all processing must be client-side)
            - Original transaction data must remain unmodified
            - Users should see both original and calculated values for transparency

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.
            Use top-level comments for general observations.
