## How It Works

Capital Gains Tax UK 101 helps you understand and calculate your capital gains tax obligations by:

1. **Importing your transaction history** from broker CSV exports
2. **Converting to GBP** using Bank of England historical rates
3. **Applying HMRC matching rules** to calculate gains/losses
4. **Visualizing the results** with clear explanations

All processing happens in your browser using IndexedDB for storage. No data is sent to any server.
