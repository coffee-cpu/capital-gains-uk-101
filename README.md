## How It Works

Capital Gains Tax Visualiser helps you understand and calculate your capital gains tax obligations by:

1. **Importing your transaction history** from broker CSV exports
2. **Converting to GBP** using HMRC official monthly exchange rates
3. **Applying HMRC matching rules** in the correct order:
   - Same-day rule: Matches buys and sells on the same day
   - 30-day rule: Matches disposals with repurchases within 30 days
   - Section 104 pool: Remaining shares pooled for average cost basis
4. **Calculating gains and losses** for each disposal with full audit trail
5. **Generating tax year summaries** with total gains, losses, and taxable amounts

All processing happens in your browser using IndexedDB for storage. No data is sent to any server.

### CGT Calculation Engine

The app implements the complete HMRC share matching rules as specified in the Capital Gains Manual:

- **Same-Day Rule** (TCGA92/S105(1) - CG51560): Shares bought and sold on the same day are matched first
- **30-Day Rule** (TCGA92/S106A(5) and (5A) - CG51560): Shares repurchased within 30 days after a sale are matched next ("bed and breakfast" anti-avoidance)
- **Section 104 Pool** (TCGA92/S104 - CG51620): All remaining shares are pooled with average cost basis

Each disposal generates a detailed record showing:
- Proceeds from sale (including fees)
- Cost basis from matched acquisitions
- Gain or loss calculation
- Tax year allocation
- Which HMRC rule was applied
